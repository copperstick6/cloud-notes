Homework 6

1. Explain the difference between Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and Infrastrcture-as-a-Service (IaaS).

IaaS is usually a endpoint that you can use to manually provision services (a.k.a it's basically a web service you can make calls to create services)

IaC is a service in which you declare what needs to be provisioned, not how it gets provisioned.

Main difference between the two is IaaS allows you to configure how/what/when you want to get something provisioned, whereas in IaC, it just cares about provisioning your resources


2)  State whether following statement are True or False:
-  IaC cannot be used with PaaS
False. PaaS can use IaC to configure its stuff

-  CloudFormation is an example of IaC whereas Terraform is an example of PaaS
False. both are IaC

-  Elastic Beanstalk uses CloudFormation snippets to customize Infrastructure resources
Definitely not. CloudFormation uses EB snippets to customize infrastructure resources

3) Multiple choice. Select all that apply:
A DevOps person is someone who:
a)  Develops applications
b)  Develops and deploys applications
c)  Develops infrastructure code
d)  Uses PaaSes
e)  Uses CloudFormation

Can be all of the above depending on design choices

Not doing 4/5. Screw that.
